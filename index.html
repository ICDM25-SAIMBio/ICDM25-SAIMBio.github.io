    <p>Medical data spans multiple modals, each providing distinct insights into biological processes. For example, image data (e.g., MRI, CT, PET) captures structural and functional characteristics of tissues and organs, providing critical insights into anatomical variations, physiological processes, and disease progression. Omics data (e.g., connectomics, genomics) captures system-wide interactions within specific biological systems, enabling deeper insights into disease pathways and personalized medicine. Demographic and structured metadata enable population-level modeling and integration of heterogeneous biomedical data for understanding complex biological systems. AI-driven data mining is crucial for uncovering informative patterns and latent structures in multimodal medical data, enabling the integration and analysis of high-dimensional biomedical data to reveal complex associations and underlying mechanisms. However, applying AI to multimodal biomedical research faces significant challenges, including data heterogeneity, interpretability, precision, and the need for trustworthy and generalizable models. Medical data, like other specialized domains, possesses intrinsic complexities that require domain expertise and careful handling. Moreover, its direct impact on clinical decision-making demands exceptionally high reliability and transparency, making it difficult to directly adopt AI models developed for general domains in medical applications. These challenges highlight the need for tailored AI solutions that ensure both robust performance and clinical trustworthiness. To address these challenges and explore how to effectively harness the benefits of advanced AI models for medical applications, we propose to organize a workshop that serves as a platform to foster interdisciplinary discussions, share advancements, and explore innovative AI-driven solutions for multimodal biomedical data analysis. </p>

    <h2>Topics of Interest</h2>
    <p>Overview: The rapid growth of multimodal biomedical data has created unprecedented opportunities for AI-driven data mining. Medical imaging (e.g., MRI, CT, PET), omics data (e.g., connectomics, genomics, proteomics), and structured metadata provide complementary insights into biological processes. AI methods play a critical role in integrating and analyzing these diverse data sources, enabling novel discoveries in disease mechanisms, precision medicine, and population health modeling. However, the complexity and heterogeneity of multimodal biomedical data introduce significant challenges. Issues such as data standardization, model interpretability, precision, and generalizability remain key barriers to effectively leveraging AI in biomedical research. This workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners to discuss recent advancements, emerging challenges, and future directions in AI-driven multimodal biomedical data mining. We invite original contributions on topics including, but not limited to:<p>
    <ul>
      <li>Deep learning for multimodal biomedical data (e.g., imaging, genetics, omics, metadata)</li>
      <li>Large foundation models for healthcare applications</li>
      <li>Multimodal fusion for diagnosis, prognosis, precision medicine</li>
      <li>Explainability, robustness, and trustworthiness in medical AI</li>
      <li>Biomarker discovery via large-scale data mining</li>
      <li>Computational challenges in biomedical data science</li>
    </ul>
